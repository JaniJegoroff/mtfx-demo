# postman-api example

### Tested setup

```
macOS Monterey
12.6.2
```
```
Postman
Version 10.1.2 (10.1.2)
```

### Additional tests/questions/improvements

1. I would add schema validation to AC-1 instead of validating few selected fields.
2. Any performance requirements?
3. Additional tests for US and FR postcodes for AC-4.
4. Additional test for invalid postcode.
5. Any additional environments where tests should be run?
